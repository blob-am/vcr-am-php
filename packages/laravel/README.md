A thin Laravel adapter around [`blob-solutions/vcr-am-sdk`](https://packagist.org/packages/blob-solutions/vcr-am-sdk). Wires the SDK's `VcrClient` into Laravel's container, publishes a config file, exposes a facade, and registers an Artisan health-check command.

The adapter contains **zero business logic** — every API call goes straight through to the SDK. If the SDK supports it, the adapter exposes it.

## Requirements

- PHP **8.2 or newer**
- Laravel **11.x or 12.x**
- A VCR.AM account and API key — sign up at [vcr.am](https://vcr.am)

## Installation

```bash
composer require blob-solutions/laravel-vcr-am
```

The service provider and facade are auto-discovered.

Add your API key to `.env`:

```env
VCR_AM_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

That's it — the package is ready to use.

## Configuration

To customise the configuration (e.g. point at a staging environment), publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=vcr-am-config
```

This creates `config/vcr-am.php`:

```php
return [
    'api_key' => env('VCR_AM_API_KEY'),
    'base_url' => env('VCR_AM_BASE_URL'), // null = SDK default (https://vcr.am/api/v1)
];
```

## Usage

### Via the facade

```php
use BlobSolutions\LaravelVcrAm\Facades\VcrAm;
use BlobSolutions\VcrAm\Input\RegisterSaleInput;

$response = VcrAm::registerSale(new RegisterSaleInput(/* ... */));
```

### Via dependency injection

```php
use BlobSolutions\VcrAm\VcrClient;

class CheckoutController
{
    public function __construct(private readonly VcrClient $vcr) {}

    public function __invoke(): RedirectResponse
    {
        $response = $this->vcr->registerSale(/* ... */);
        // ...
    }
}
```

`VcrClient` is bound as a singleton, so the same instance is reused for the lifetime of every request.

### Via the container

```php
$client = app(VcrClient::class);
```

## Health check

To verify connectivity from a running app or as part of your deployment pipeline:

```bash
php artisan vcr-am:health
```

```
VCR.AM API reachable.
  VCR    : "My Shop" (CRN 1234567890123)
  Mode   : production
  Entity : My Shop LLC (TIN 01234567)
```

`Mode` is `production` or `sandbox` — useful at a glance for confirming which VCR your API key is wired to. Add `--sandbox` to point the check at the parallel sandbox client (see [Testing against a sandbox VCR](#testing-against-a-sandbox-vcr) below).

Exit code is `0` on success, `1` on failure (with the SDK's error message printed).

## Testing

There are two distinct testing strategies. Pick whichever fits the seam you're testing:

| You want… | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Unit tests that never touch the network | [`VcrAm::fake()`](#unit-tests-vcramfake) |
| Smoke tests / staging against a real VCR | [Sandbox channel](#testing-against-a-sandbox-vcr) |

### Unit tests: `VcrAm::fake()`

Modelled on Laravel's `Http::fake()`. After calling `VcrAm::fake()`, every resolution of `VcrClient` (via the facade, `app(VcrClient::class)`, or constructor DI) returns a fake that records every request and rejects every un-stubbed endpoint with a clear `RuntimeException` — so SDK calls the test didn't expect surface as test failures, not as silent passes.

```php
use BlobSolutions\LaravelVcrAm\Facades\VcrAm;

it('fiscalises checkout via VCR.AM', function (): void {
    VcrAm::fake([
        'POST /sales' => [
            'urlId' => 'abc',
            'saleId' => 42,
            'crn' => '1234567890123',
            'srcReceiptId' => 100,
            'fiscal' => 'F-1',
        ],
    ]);

    $this->postJson('/checkout', [/* ... */])->assertSuccessful();

    VcrAm::assertSentCount(1);
    VcrAm::assertSent(
        'POST /sales',
        fn (?array $body) => ($body['cashier']['deskId'] ?? null) === 'desk-1',
    );
});
```

Stub forms:

```php
// Plain array — turned into a 200 JSON response.
VcrAm::fake([
    'POST /sales' => ['urlId' => 'X', /* ... */],
]);

// Closure — receives the captured PSR-7 request, returns either a
// ResponseInterface or a plain array.
VcrAm::fake([
    'POST /sales' => function (Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface $request) {
        return ['urlId' => 'dyn', /* ... */];
    },
]);

// Throw a server-side error to test how your code handles failures.
use Nyholm\Psr7\Response;

VcrAm::fake([
    'POST /sales' => fn () => new Response(
        400,
        ['Content-Type' => 'application/json'],
        '{"code":"VALIDATION","message":"price must be positive"}',
    ),
]);
```

Assertions:

```php
VcrAm::assertSent('POST /sales');                          // any matching request
VcrAm::assertSent('POST /sales', fn (?array $body) => /* ... */);  // narrow on body
VcrAm::assertNotSent('POST /prepayments');                 // negative assertion
VcrAm::assertNothingSent();                                // no SDK calls at all
VcrAm::assertSentCount(2);                                 // exact request count
```

The matcher syntax is `"METHOD /path"`. Method is case-insensitive, path is exact. The SDK base path (`/api/v1`) is stripped automatically so stubs read like the endpoints documented in the SDK source (`POST /sales`, not `POST /api/v1/sales`).

### Testing against a sandbox VCR

The SDK has no operating-mode flag of its own — sandbox is determined entirely by the VCR an API key authenticates against. To run real HTTP calls during integration testing without touching production, create a sandbox VCR at [vcr.am](https://vcr.am), generate an API key for it, and point this package at it.

Quickest setup — overwrite the default key in your testing environment:

```env
# .env.testing
VCR_AM_API_KEY=sk_sandbox_...
```

Or run two clients side-by-side — useful when a single app needs both for different flows (e.g. real receipts in production paths, sandbox receipts in an E2E suite that runs against the same deploy):

```env
# .env
VCR_AM_API_KEY=sk_live_...
VCR_AM_SANDBOX_API_KEY=sk_sandbox_...
```

```php
VcrAm::registerSale($input);             // hits the production VCR
VcrAm::sandbox()->registerSale($input);  // hits the sandbox VCR
```

The sandbox `VcrClient` is also resolvable through the container:

```php
use BlobSolutions\LaravelVcrAm\VcrAmServiceProvider;
use BlobSolutions\VcrAm\VcrClient;

$sandbox = app(VcrAmServiceProvider::SANDBOX_BINDING); // returns VcrClient
```

Calling `VcrAm::sandbox()` without `VCR_AM_SANDBOX_API_KEY` set throws a `RuntimeException` — deliberately, so production code never silently downgrades to the default key.

### Health check, sandbox edition

`vcr-am:health` also accepts `--sandbox` and reports the sandbox VCR's identity:

```bash
php artisan vcr-am:health --sandbox
```

```
VCR.AM API reachable.
  VCR    : "My Shop (sandbox)" (CRN not activated)
  Mode   : sandbox
  Entity : My Shop LLC (TIN 01234567)
```

## Logging

The package forwards Laravel's PSR-3 logger into the SDK automatically. Every request and response is logged at the level configured in your `config/logging.php`. To filter only VCR.AM log entries, give the SDK its own channel:

```php
// config/logging.php
'channels' => [
    'vcr-am' => [
        'driver' => 'daily',
        'path' => storage_path('logs/vcr-am.log'),
        'days' => 14,
    ],
],
```

```php
// AppServiceProvider::register()
$this->app->bind(\Psr\Log\LoggerInterface::class, fn () => Log::channel('vcr-am'));
```

## HTTP client override

The SDK ships with Guzzle 7 by default. To swap it (e.g. for testing or to use a shared HTTP client with custom retry policies), bind a PSR-18 implementation in your `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
$this->app->bind(\Psr\Http\Client\ClientInterface::class, fn () => new MyHttpClient());
```

The adapter detects this binding and passes it into the SDK constructor.

## Documentation for SDK methods

See the [SDK README](https://github.com/blob-am/vcr-am-sdk-php) for every endpoint, every input DTO, and every response type. The Laravel adapter is a 1:1 wrapper — anything documented for `VcrClient` works through the facade or container binding.
